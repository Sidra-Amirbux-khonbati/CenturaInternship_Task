# C Programming Tasks

This repository contains three C programming tasks that demonstrate problem-solving, file handling, data structures, and encryption techniques.


# Mini Library Management System
A console-based tool to manage books using file storage in C.

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This program allows:
- Adding books with title, author, and ISBN.
- Searching books by title.
- Deleting books.
- Displaying all books.
- Saving and loading data from a file.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Persistent storage in `library_records.txt`.
- Search by exact title match.
- Displays total number of books.
- Supports up to 100 books.


# VigenÃ¨re Cipher Encryption Tool
A C program to encrypt and decrypt text using the VigenÃ¨re Cipher method.

## ðŸ“Œ Description
- Uses a keyword to shift characters.
- Works with uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Keeps spaces and non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Encrypts input text.
- Decrypts to recover original text.
- Case-sensitive encryption.


# Quadratic Equation Solver
This C program solves quadratic equations of the form **axÂ² + bx + c = 0**.

## ðŸ“Œ Description
The program:
- Takes coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.
- Calculates the discriminant `bÂ² - 4ac`.
- Determines the type of roots:
  - Real and distinct
  - Real and equal
  - Complex (imaginary)

## ðŸš€ Features
- User-friendly input prompts.
- Handles all root types.
- Shows the complete equation and discriminant before solving.
